# Stock Screener

This is a project to build a cool stock/asset screener with the goal of making it easier to make the right investments.

## Notes

* Original idea was to use Polygon.io, but it only offers US stocks/etf's on the free plan
* Tried Alpha Vantage but it, similarily to Polytgon.io only offers US assets
* Still have to investigate yfinance api, but rumors says it's shaky (uses webscrapers etc). However, it seems to offer the biggest coverage.

* Not sure if this is in scope for this project, but one idea would be to initiate trades on freetrade through its unofficial api
    * Blog about it https://medium.com/@kunsitu/freetrade-api-wrapper-unofficial-6dd36e65dd37
    * Github page https://github.com/situkun123/FreeTradeWrapper
* Interesting service for exchange rates https://exchangeratesapi.io/
* Combining AV and Polygon.io seems to be the best solution
