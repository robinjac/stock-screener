# Stock Screener

This is a project to build a cool stock/asset screener with the goal of making it easier to make the right investments.

## Notes

* Original idea was to use Polygon.io, but it only offers US stocks/etf's on the free plan
* Tried Alpha Vantage but it, similarily to Polytgon.io only offers US assets
* Still have to investigate yfinance api, but rumors says it's shaky (uses webscrapers etc). However, it seems to offer the biggest coverage.
